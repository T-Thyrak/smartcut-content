# What is a primitive data structure?

A primitive data structure is a type of data structure that holds only one type and one item. Well, technically, the only primitive data structure is a bit, but when we refer to primitives, we actually refer to common data types such as a 64-bit integer or something.

Primitive data structures usually includes integers, floats, characters, and pointers.

Difference between primitive data structures and non-primitive data structures:

Primitive data structure | Non-Primitive data structure
---|---
Primitive data structure is a kind of data structure that holds only one type and one item. | Non-primitive data structure is a kind of data structure that can hold multiple types and multiple items.
Example of primitive data structures are integers, floats, characters, and pointers. | Example of non-primitive data structures are arrays, linked lists, and trees.
Primitive data structure cannot contain NULL. | Non-primitive data structure can contain NULL.
The size of a primitive data structure is fixed, i.e. a 32-bit integer is 4 bytes. | The size of a non-primitive data structure is variable, depending on the data type and data amount.
Usual naming convention starts the name of a primitive data structure with a small letter. | Usual naming convention starts the name of a non-primitive data structure with a capital letter.
